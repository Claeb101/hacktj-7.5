## Inspiration
Before Thanksgiving, one of our team members was having trouble coming up with a programming project idea. Ironically, he eventually had the idea to build a project idea platform for sharing ideas. After introducing the idea

Intially, our team was having a lot of difficulty coming up with a creative idea for HackTJ 7.5. But, we soon had the idea to build a platform for sharing project ideas hoping that others wouldn't have to go through the same struggle we just faced. This situation has frequently occured to a number of our team members, thus ideatree was born.

## What it does
IdeaTree is a project ideas platform for developers and STEM enthusiasts.

On our platform, any user is able to post ideas that are then rated for quality based on documentation given, crowd upvoting, and other metrics.

Then, others are able to search through our curated topics from biology, computer science, and physics just to name a few. 

Once a user finds a particular project idea that suits their need, they are able to mark progression through the project from start to completion. 

Additionally, in case users get stuck while working, we provide tools that allow them to contact other users who completed the project. This enhances productivity and promotes a healthy learning environment for the scientific community.

Finally, users can become "senior planters" through a verification process adding credibility to their ideas, completed projects, and responses.

With these tools, IdeaTree aims to help creators, developers, and science enthusiasts overcome "idea block" through the power of open-source.
